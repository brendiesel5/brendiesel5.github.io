1960-1965 


First a general date to quantity graph for the samples, X axis being dates in 5 year intervals, and Y axis being the amount of samples from that time. 

Then same thing but only showing samples for each individual album that you can scroll through, to see if there was a general trend of timeframe he sampled from for the different styles. for example for TCD album there could be more from the soul era, whereas an album like yeezus would probably have more modern samples.
